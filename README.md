# UI Best Practices

### Best Standards
- Design mobile first, then scale up. 
    - We will put whats important in the mobile view
    - If we start with desktop, there may be unnecessary items on the page.
- Spacing should be on an 8pt scale 
- Create a set of predefined shadow and spacing options
- Left align edges and align text to baseline
- Use the rule of thirds for photos
- Safest to use sans serif for most type interfaces- it's netural and easy to read.
- Text align left (not justify left) it messes with spacing between words.
- Use sentence case
- visual heirarchy is very important
  - Use the reverse pyramid startegy
  - Font Size is very important
  - use the squint test to see what stands out or doesn't

### Design with usability in Mind.
- Always consider the usability risk, (who won’t find my UI helpful? Blind, Colorblind, etc)
- Minimize interaction cost
    - How far your button is from the text
    - how many steps in a form?
- Use design patterns that people are familiar with to reduce cognitive load
- Links should be underlined to be obvious

### Color
- Avoid being creative with color.
- Use the primary brand color, with 5 variations. 
- Define them so you don’t need to think about picking colors again.
- Adjust photo color temperature to match the pallet.
   
 ### Forms and Cards 
- Break up forms into smaller sections, not all in one page.
- Place items that belong to each other in their own container.
- Avoid abbreviations in forms
- Stack form inputs rather than side by side
